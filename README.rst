this is a fork of kparal's sendKindle.
it has the same features but it will warn + ignore missing password, rather than requiring you to enter one.
(this is appropriate for other forms of smtp relay authentication.)
small but useful change.  thanks for @kparal for original work, still a useful piece of software.
